# Cool R Stuff

There are indeed many cool things about R, but I think my favorite among
them was actually something I just learned earlier today while finishing
up the regression homework. I have not had much exposure to the `caret`
package but being able to do so many steps of model building within a
single function call seems like a real game changer to me. In comparison
to doing the same process in Python, this method seems much more elegant
and easier. In general R’s reliance on packages that have so many
co-dependencies is a little frustrating at times but for outcomes like
this where it really cuts down on the work time, I definitely think it
seems worth it. In the code chunk below, I use an example kind of like
the one we used in the homework to train a model with cross validation
and then make predictions.

``` r
library(caret)

# Reading in the dataset from before
raw_data <- readr::read_csv("SeoulBikeData.csv", locale = readr::locale(encoding = "latin1"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Date = col_character(),
    ##   `Rented Bike Count` = col_double(),
    ##   Hour = col_double(),
    ##   `Temperature(°C)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Humidity(%)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Wind speed (m/s)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Visibility (10m)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Dew point temperature(°C)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Rainfall(mm)` = col_double(),
    ##   `Snowfall (cm)` = col_double(),
    ##   Seasons = col_character(),
    ##   Holiday = col_character(),
    ##   `Functioning Day` = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
bikes <- raw_data[,2:14]

train_index <- createDataPartition(bikes$`Rented Bike Count`, p = .8, list = FALSE)

bike_train <- bikes[train_index, ]
bike_test <- bikes[-train_index, ]

model <- train(`Rented Bike Count` ~., data=bike_train, method = "lm", 
            preProcess = c("center", "scale"), trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5))

data.frame(t(model$results))
```

    ##                      X1
    ## intercept    1.00000000
    ## RMSE       432.60534252
    ## Rsquared     0.55062978
    ## MAE        323.29832880
    ## RMSESD      10.16213953
    ## RsquaredSD   0.01358885
    ## MAESD        6.78096532

``` r
pred <- predict(model, newdata = bike_test)

postResample(pred, obs = bike_test$`Rented Bike Count`)
```
