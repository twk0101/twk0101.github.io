I really enjoyed this project as it gave us a lot of creative freedom to explore the world of APIs for ourselves and sort of play around with whatever we could come up with. I'm glad I picked the PokeAPI to work with, as it brought back a ton of fun memories of the games from my earlier years and I was surprised about how much of the knowledge I still had locked away in my brain somewhere.

I'd say the most difficult part of the project for me was just getting everything set up and familiarizing myself with the structure of the API and what R functionality I needed to lean on in order to make sure everything was coming in and going out to the right place from the API and out into the github world. I thought this was a great combination though of a lot of the different tools we've used throughought the class so far though so I enjoyed the challenge of getting all the puzzle pieces to work together.

I think I'd give myself a little more time to work on this if I was going to do it again, I'm scrambling a bit here towards the end and I think I could have done it better if I put a little more effort into it.
