I really enjoyed working on this project and felt like it was a great learning experience. We started out our project looking at the entertainment data channel before automating our methods for all of the available channels. We looked into a few variables with some plots and numerical summaries before building several models using a training set split off from the data. We took a more hollistic approach with the models and used all of the available features in the hopes of casting a wide net to capture statistical significance.

In terms of what I'd do differently, I think I had a much better approach to this project than the last one and Steph was a really great and organized partner to have! I think I may have drilled down into the features a little bit more as opposed to using all of them for my models but I don't think it was a bad approach to use all of them.

The most difficult part for me was probably working through how to automate the process for all of the different data channels. Getting the variable name into our data filtering function was a little tricky but once we got it rolling it went pretty smoothly!

I think my biggest takeaway from this project was seeing the value in having something like this project written and being able to continuiously provide valuable insights into a dataset without requiring a significant amount of maintenance once it was written initially, which I think is a really intriguing concept.
